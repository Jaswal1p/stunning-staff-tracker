 # Description
 This was my first foray into creating a Content Management Systems (CMS), by building a command-line application from scratch to manage a small hospital's employee database. This was challenging assignment due to amount of information which needed to be understood, hard-coded, tested, applied and properly refactored. This became extremley difficult with a full time career, classes and having to search some javascript info from front-end lessons & google. 

 I divided the project into 4 parts:
 A: Setting up the project with directory structure, loading dependencies and setting up db files as suggested by assignment description.

 B: Worked on server.js for inquirer questions flow as required by assignment, coded for all required criteria. over 3-4 days this code balloned in size significantly then what i thought.

 C: Refactor: I refactored the code by creating lib folder containg separate department-method.js, role-method.js and employee-methods.js. Later added reset.js file as well. Working on this ReadMe file is also in this part.
 
 # BONUS
 D: At the end I worked SUCCESSFULLY on 3 of the 5 Bonus points mentioned in the assignment. 

Future directions for this assignment:
 1. Would like to work on adding 4rth bonus point of budget of a particular department.
 2. Would like to some day use async & await functions in methods.
 3. Would love to someday rebuild this assignment with sequalize, which I am learning right now!

Challenges:
 1. Not enough time! I need 30 hrs in a day to give uniterrupted 6hrs/day to code (Career already takes-up 9-10 hrs a day & sometimes weekend call too), to do justice with my learning plus proper concept understanding !!!
 2. BCS is of no help lately. On the contrary some of them are rude, sometimes unwilling to talk on zoom and just throw up articles & videos, which I have already referred to. They constantly pass their work to their next colleague.
 3. Availabilty of TAs is unpredictable. They are all great and extremely helpful. Its just that my time doesn't match with theirs. Office hours are great. Helped me out a great deal this and last saturday.
